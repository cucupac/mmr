## A Solidity Merkle Mountain Range Implementation

This repository contains a Merkle Mountain Range implementaion in solidity.

## Benefits

1. A merkle mountain range allows for data to progressively be added to the structure without the need to compute hashes for the entire structure each leaf addition.
2. It enables the proof of a leaf's set membership within mountain.
3. It enables the proof of a mountain's set membership within full data set (mountain range).
